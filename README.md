# tinkering-with-tensorflow

Some silly examples to get you started build LTSM models to generate stuff.

You'll need to install `python` (including `pip`), and [`tensorflow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

After that, run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you're ready to run any of the examples! e.g.

    ./monsters/monster_generator.py
